                  the first practical realization of such a cloak; in
                  our demonstration, a copper cylinder was
                  ``hidden{''} inside a cloak constructed according to
                  the previous theoretical prescription. The cloak was
                  constructed with the use of artificially structured
                  metamaterials, designed for operation over a band of
                  microwave frequencies. The cloak decreased
                  scattering from the hidden object while at the same
                  time reducing its shadow, so that the cloak and
                  object combined began to resemble empty space.}},

Abstract = {{An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing
   were there, regardless of where the light comes from. Ideal invisibility
   devices are impossible, owing to the wave nature of light. This study
   develops a general recipe for the design of media that create perfect
   invisibility within the accuracy of geometrical optics. The
   imperfections of invisibility can be made arbitrarily small to hide
   objects that are much larger than the wavelength. With the use of modern
   metamaterials, practical demonstrations of such devices may be possible.
   The method developed here can also be applied to escape detection by
   other electromagnetic waves or sound.}},

This formulism permits the mechanism of light scattering to be studied.An efficient algorithm is introduced that permits stable calculation for a large sphere with many layers. The formation of triple first-order rainbows by a three-layered sphere and single-order rainbows and the interference of different-order rainbows by a sphere with a gradient refractive index, are then studied by use of the Debye model and Mie calculation. The possibility of taking only one single mode or several modes for each layer is shown to be useful in the study of the scattering characteristics of a multilayered sphere and in the measurement of the sizes and refractive indices of particles.},

abstract = {Abstract: Using Mie theory and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) we compare the properties of dielectric particle and void resonators. We show that void resonators---low refractive index inclusions within a high index embedding medium---exhibit larger bandwidth resonances, reduced peak scattering intensity, different polarization anisotropies, and enhanced forward scattering when compared to their particle (high index inclusions in a low index medium) counterparts. We evaluate amorphous silicon solar cell textures comprising either arrays of voids or particles. Both designs support substantial absorption enhancements (up to 45\%) relative to a flat cell with anti-reflection coating, over a large range of cell thicknesses. By leveraging void-based textures 90\% of above-bandgap photons are absorbed in cells with maximal vertical dimension of 100 nm.},

  abstract={Light absorption by a spatially uniform spherical nanoparticle in the vicinity of surface plasmon (polariton) resonances is studied in detail based on the exact Mie solution. It is shown that the maximal absorption is achieved for a particle from weakly dissipating materials and may have very unusual properties. A simple universal formula describing the resonant absorption lineshape as a function of the particle size and its complex dielectric permittivity is obtained. Possible comparison with experiment is discussed.}
